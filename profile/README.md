**CLEAR&nbsp; 💙 &nbsp;Developers.** We value the role that developers play as dreamers and builders of our collective future. What’s more – we extend our data security prowess on your behalf; the **_Powered by_ CLEAR** platform respects user consent, allows you to simulate identities outside your personal context and provides end-to-end transparency into the way data is acquired, verified and shared. Welcome aboard!
